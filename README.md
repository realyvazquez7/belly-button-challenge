BioD3: Visualizing Microbial Ecosystems

Project Overview

This project embarks on an interactive exploration of microbial data from various individuals, leveraging the D3.js library to parse and visualize information from a comprehensive JSON dataset. At its core, the initiative aims to unveil the top Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) present in individuals, employing a variety of dynamic visualizations such as horizontal bar charts and bubble charts to represent the data's complexity and richness. Through an intuitive interface featuring dropdown menus and responsive charts, users can navigate through the dataset to uncover insights into the microbial communities within each sample. The visualization effort extends to displaying demographic metadata, enriching the context of each dataset explored. Designed with accessibility in mind, the project is hosted on GitHub Pages, inviting users to engage with the data meaningfully and interactively. This endeavor highlights the capabilities of web-based data visualization tools and underscores the potential for a deeper understanding of microbiological ecosystems through data analytics.

Deployment

Explore the fascinating world of microbial ecosystems with our interactive dashboard: BioD3: Visualizing Microbial Ecosystems.

Data

The data for this project originates from an intriguing study conducted by Hulcr, J. et al. (2012), titled "A Jungle in There: Bacteria in Belly Buttons are Highly Diverse, but Predictable." This research unveils the astonishing diversity and predictability of bacterial ecosystems residing in human belly buttons, drawing on samples collected from a wide range of participants. The study, accessible through the Rob Dunn Lab's website, offers a comprehensive exploration into the microcosm that thrives within our navels, highlighting the complex interplay of factors that determine the composition of these bacterial communities. Our interactive dashboard leverages this rich dataset, enabling users to visualize and understand the bacterial diversity present in different individuals' belly buttons, illustrating the broader implications of microbial biodiversity on human health and ecology.
